# IPro 497 – Product Direction Document

## Problem statement
Please provide two problem statements.  They are the same problem but take two passes at it.
Teachers frequently take the help of Teachers Assistants to answer common questions, take attendance, and provide learning assistance. Time constraints and workload can often prevent TAs from ensuring adequate support to all students. A virtual assistant will benefit students, professors, and TAs by saving time and providing answers to several frequently asked topics. (NLU)
Teachers struggle to keep track of which students are in class, and many of them waste valuable class time taking attendance. Automated procedures can ensure proper efficiency. (maximum teaching time).

## Top Two to Three Scenarios
Your Scenario #1:
Mike is having difficulties in his physics class. He gets very confused about the material and tries to reach out to the TA. The TA is overloaded with questions and Mike receives an email from the TA saying that she will respond to all emails as soon as she can. He does not hear back from the TA for 2 days and decides to use the AI TA chat bot to help him understand the material in physics. 

Your Scenario #2:
John has missed a couple of lectures due to covid and now he has fallen back in his course. He also hasn’t had time to attend TA office hours due to having other online classes during that time. So, this allows him to use the AI TA chat bot to get caught up with all questions he needs answered.

Your Scenario #3:
Professor Wick is feeling a bit sick and needs time off from work. AI assistant chabot can use NLP to scan the document that the professor has uploaded. This will allow an AI assistant to cover the missing lecture that the student may have missed.

If someone does not complete a task they should try to complete it by the next meeting.
Before putting up a task in the kanban board, as a group we all should decide on the workload on a scale of 1 - 10. This will ensure that everyone has a task with equal amounts of work.
