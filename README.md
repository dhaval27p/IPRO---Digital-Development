           <summary>Scenario #1</summary>
           <p>Mike is having difficulties in his physics class. He gets very confused about the material and tries to reach out to the TA. The TA is overloaded with questions and Mike receives an email from the TA saying that she will respond to all emails as soon as she can. He does not hear back from the TA for 2 days and decides to use the AI TA chat bot to help him understand the material in physics.</p>

           <p>John has missed a couple of lectures due to covid and now he has fallen back in his course. He also hasn’t had time to attend TA office hours due to having other online classes during that time. So, this allows him to use the AI TA chat bot to get caught up with all questions he needs answered.</p>
